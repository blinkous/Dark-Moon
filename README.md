## Dark Moon
This is an Android app that explores the use of the NASA API. So far, the app displays the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) on the home screen. The app is built using Java, Android Studio, Android XML, NASA API, Retrofit by Square for API processing, and Picasso by Square for turning image URLs into actual ImageViews.
